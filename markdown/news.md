	No doubt you’ve noticed, visuals are amongst us almost every minute of the day. A considerable amount of people are visual thinkers.. We all know the quote: “a picture is worth a thousand words.” In websites and social media we use more and more images to differentiate the message from the gray text masses.
	A tweet with a photo is more likely to be recognized or retweeted. An update on LinkedIn is more read, liked or shared when an image is used. A post with an image attracts more likes on Facebook. Pinterest, Snapchat and Instagram are among the fastest growing social media channels. We can safely conclude that images are necessary to get a message across.
