	Carlos Arteta is a post-doctoral researcher at the VGG group,
	University of Oxford, working for the Seebibyte Project.. His
	research interest is in the application of learning-based computer
	vision to real image-based data analysis challenges across multiple disciplines.
	His previous work mainly focused on microscopy image analysis, and he currently
	works in diverse areas such as zoology and material sciences.

*   # Dr Vasileios Belagiannis

	Vasileios Belagiannis is a postdoc researcher at the University of Oxford,
	working for the Seebibyte Project. His research is mainly focused on understanding 
	human behaviour from image and video data, by designing models for human detection,
	tracking and pose estimation. Previously, Dr Belagiannis proposed models for these
	objectives based on computer vision principles. To automatize this process, he oriented
	his research towards machine learning and, more recently, deep learning fundamentals.
	Learning representations and structures directly from data, using feedforward and recurrent deep neural networks,
	is one of the central goals of his research. Currently, Dr Belagiannis is working on exploring regression models
	that can be applied to different computer vision problems. His role on the Seebibyte Project
	will focus on research on deep learning for computer vision problems, where the outcome can be
	transferred into different disciplines and applied in non-vision tasks.

	Abhishek Dutta is a Seebibyte Project Research Software Engineer.
	His research interests span a wide range of avenues in Computer Vision,
	Machine Learning and Computer Graphics. Abhishek received his doctorate at the
	University of Twente (Netherlands) in 2015 after which he joined the Product Lab
	of TomTom International as a Senior Engineer. He obtained his Bachelorâ€™s degree
	in Computer Engineering from the Tribhuvan University (Nepal) in 2009 and MSc
	in Computer Science (by research) from the University of York (UK) in 2010.

*   # Dr Ernesto Coto

	Ernesto Coto is a Seebibyte Project Research Software Engineer.
	He received his PhD degree in Computer Sciences from the Central University
	of Venezuela (UCV) in 2008. He has previously worked as an Academic at UCV for 13 years,
	reaching the position of Aggregate Professor, as well as he has professional
	experience as Software Developer for a range of companies and other universities.
	From 2013-2016 he was a key member of the Scientific Software Development Team
	of the Center for Computational Imaging & Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB)
	at the University of Sheffield, UK. He has co-authored numerous scientific articles,
	published in international journals and congresses. He has also organized international
	conferences, done peer-reviewing for numerous scientific events and is the co-inventor
	of one pending patent in the UK. His main research interests span Computer Graphics,
	Scientific Visualization and Image Processing; and more recently Computer Vision
	and Machine Learning.

*   # Dr Weilin Huang

	Weilin Huang is a postdoc researcher at the University of Oxford,
	working for the Seebibyte Project. His research interests are in
	deep learning and computer vision, with applications to biomedical
	image/video analysis. Previously, Dr Huang worked on deep learning
	methods for scene text recognition and image classification.
	Currently, he is working on recurrent neural networks (RNN) related 
	methods. The goal is to develop a powerful deep model that is able
	to learn strong temporal information from video, with weakly-supervised
	or unsupervised data. As part of the Seebibyte Project, one important
	application is for Ultrasound video analysis, such as frame-level
	classification and instance localisation. The temporal information
	is particularly important for understanding Ultrasound content,
	while large-scale labelling of medical video is generally expensive.
