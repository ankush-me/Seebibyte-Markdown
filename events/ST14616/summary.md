## Software Demo

This demo shows our algorithms for localising and recognising text in images. Try it on an image from your computer or provide an image weblink. Automatic text recognition technology for unstructured images makes large image databases searchable, and provides insights into their content. This demo aims at finding text at the word level and providing a machine readable transcription.
