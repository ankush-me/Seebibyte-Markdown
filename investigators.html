	<h4>Investigators</h4>
	
	<ul>
<li><h1>PROF. ANDREW ZISSERMAN</h1>
<p><img src="images/inv1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Prof. Andrew Zisserman, FRS, is the Principal Investigator for Seebibyte. He is the Professor of Computer Vision Engineering in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, and the founder of the Visual Geometry Group (VGG). He is a Fellow of the Royal Society. Prof. Zisserman is known internationally for his pioneering work in multiple view geometry, visual recognition, and large scale retrieval in images and video. He has authored over 350 peer reviewed papers in computer vision, and coedited and written several books in this area. His papers have won many best paper awards at international conferences (at CVPR, ICCV and BMVC), including the IEEE Marr prize three times. He regularly serves as programme chair or general chair for international computer vision conferences. In 2002 he received a Technical Emmy Award (with the company 2d3) for camera-tracking software. In 2013 he was awarded the Longuet-Higgins prize and the IEEE PAMI Distinguished Researcher award.</p></li>
<li><h1>PROF. ALISON NOBLE</h1>
<p><img src="images/inv2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Prof. Alison Noble, OBE FREng, is the Technikos Professor of Biomedical Engineering in the Oxford University Department of Engineering Science and the Director of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering. She is a Fellow of the IET, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and Past-President of the MICCAI Society. She was awarded an OBE for services to Science and Engineering in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in June 2013. Professor Noble is the founding director of the Biomedical Image Analysis (BioMedIA) Laboratory, an inter-disciplinary research group working in the field of biomedical image analysis based at the Oxford Institute of Biomedical Engineering. Her group is supported by research awards from EPSRC, NIHR, NIH, InnovateUK, and the Wellcome Trust. Much of her group’s current research concerns machine-learning applied to biomedical image analysis with a focus on clinical applications of ultrasound imaging. Professor Noble has published around 300 peer-reviewed papers. She is also a co-founder and the Chief Technology Officer of Intelligent Ultrasound Ltd.</p></li>
<li><h1>PROF. ANDREA VEDALDI</h1>
<p><img src="images/inv3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Prof. Andrea Vedaldi is Professor in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. He is an expert in large scale machine learning and optimization applied to semantic image understanding. Prof. Vedaldi is the author of more than 30 peer-reviewed publications. He is project leader of VLFeat, a very popular computer vision software toolkit (ACM Open Source Award 2010). In 2012 he was team leader of the Johns Hopkins CLSP summer research workshop, coordinating a number of senior researchers and students in a research program on detailed image understanding. He is collaborating with BP on several applications of computer vision to the gas and oil industry and with MirriAd on image understanding applied to virtual advertisement. He serves regularly as area chair and reviewer of the top computer vision conferences (ICCV/CVPR/ECCV/BMVC) and he is an editor of TPAMI. He organised five tutorials at ECCV and CVPR and three international computer vision summer schools (JHU NAACL, PAVIS).</p></li>
<li><h1>PROF. PHIL TORR</h1>
<p><img src="images/inv4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Prof. Phil Torr is Professorial Research Fellow in the Oxford University Department of Engineering Science. He has worked on several areas of computer vision including energy models for scene understanding, online tracking and learning of objects, and robust estimation of multiview geometry. He has received best paper awards in every major computer vision conference (ICCV, ECCV, CVPR, BMVC) and an honourable mention at NIPS. In the past ten years, Prof. Torr has attracted nearly five million pounds of funding (EPSRC and ERC). His work has had extensive application in the creative industries, with recent technology transfers including contributions to Vicon’s motion capture technology (won Best KTP 2009), and vision technology underlying Sony’s Wonderbook. He is also Director of new Oxford based spin out Oxsight, working on smart specs for the partially sighted. Last year Prof. Torr was program chair of the top conference in computer vision ICCV, and in the past was program chair for ECCV and BMVC.</p></li>
<li><h1>PROF. JENS RITTSCHER</h1>
<p><img src="images/inv5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The research of Prof. Jens Rittscher is to enable biomedical imaging through the development of new algorithms and novel computational platforms. The current focus of his research is to improve mechanistic understanding of cancer and patient care through quantitative analysis of image data. In 2013, he was appointed to the first joint academic appointment between the Department of Engineering Science and the Nuffield Department of Medicine (NDM) at the University of Oxford. He has been awarded the title of Professor of Engineering Science. He is a group leader at the NDM's Target Discovery Institute and is a member of the Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research. rior to coming to Oxford, Prof. Rittscher was a senior research scientist and manager at GE Global Research in Niskayuna (NY, USA), one of the world’s largest and most diversified industrial research laboratories. Building on his extensive expertise in computer vision, probabilistic modelling and statistical learning, he developed new theoretical approaches that address specific real-world challenge problems in automated video annotation, visual surveillance, and biomedical imaging. In the context of biomedical imaging he worked on applications ranging from monitoring cellular processes and computational pathology to the development of an anatomical atlas for zebrafish imaging. In addition he held a position as an adjunct professor at the Rensselear Polytechnic Institute in Troy (NY, USA). In 2001 he was awarded a DPhil from the University of Oxford for his work on recognizing human motion.</p></li>
