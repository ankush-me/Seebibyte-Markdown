	<h4>Researchers</h4>
	<ul>
<li><h1>DR CARLOS ARTETA</h1>
<p><img src="images/res1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Carlos Arteta is a post-doctoral researcher at the VGG group, University of Oxford, working for the Seebibyte Project.. His research interest is in the application of learning-based computer vision to real image-based data analysis challenges across multiple disciplines. His previous work mainly focused on microscopy image analysis, and he currently works in diverse areas such as zoology and material sciences.</p></li>
<li><h1>DR VASILEIOS BELAGIANNIS</h1>
<p><img src="images/res2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Vasileios Belagiannis is a postdoc researcher at the University of Oxford, working for the Seebibyte Project. His research is mainly focused on understanding human behaviour from image and video data, by designing models for human detection, tracking and pose estimation. Previously, Dr Belagiannis proposed models for these objectives based on computer vision principles. To automatize this process, he oriented his research towards machine learning and, more recently, deep learning fundamentals. Learning representations and structures directly from data, using feedforward and recurrent deep neural networks, is one of the central goals of his research. Currently, Dr Belagiannis is working on exploring regression models that can be applied to different computer vision problems. His role on the Seebibyte Project will focus on research on deep learning for computer vision problems, where the outcome can be transferred into different disciplines and applied in non-vision tasks.</p></li>
<li><h1>DR ABHISHEK DUTTA</h1>
<p><img src="images/res3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Abhishek Dutta is a Seebibyte Project Research Software Engineer. His research interests span a wide range of avenues in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Computer Graphics. Abhishek received his doctorate at the University of Twente (Netherlands) in 2015 after which he joined the Product Lab of TomTom International as a Senior Engineer. He obtained his Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from the Tribhuvan University (Nepal) in 2009 and MSc in Computer Science (by research) from the University of York (UK) in 2010.</p></li>
<li><h1>DR ERNESTO COTO</h1>
<p><img src="images/res4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Ernesto Coto is a Seebibyte Project Research Software Engineer. He received his PhD degree in Computer Sciences from the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) in 2008. He has previously worked as an Academic at UCV for 13 years, reaching the position of Aggregate Professor, as well as he has professional experience as Software Developer for a range of companies and other universities. From 2013-2016 he was a key member of the Scientific Software Development Team of the Center for Computational Imaging &amp; Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB) at the University of Sheffield, UK. He has co-authored numerous scientific articles, published in international journals and congresses. He has also organized international conferences, done peer-reviewing for numerous scientific events and is the co-inventor of one pending patent in the UK. His main research interests span Computer Graphics, Scientific Visualization and Image Processing; and more recently Computer Vision and Machine Learning.</p></li>
<li><h1>DR WEILIN HUANG</h1>
<p><img src="images/res5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Weilin Huang is a postdoc researcher at the University of Oxford, working for the Seebibyte Project. His research interests are in deep learning and computer vision, with applications to biomedical image/video analysis. Previously, Dr Huang worked on deep learning methods for scene text recognition and image classification. Currently, he is working on recurrent neural networks (RNN) related methods. The goal is to develop a powerful deep model that is able to learn strong temporal information from video, with weakly-supervised or unsupervised data. As part of the Seebibyte Project, one important application is for Ultrasound video analysis, such as frame-level classification and instance localisation. The temporal information is particularly important for understanding Ultrasound content, while large-scale labelling of medical video is generally expensive.</p></li>
