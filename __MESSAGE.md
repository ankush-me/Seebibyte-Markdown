#	To Ankush and Seebibyte Team,

Since the website is near completion, I decided to leave a short message. Thank you for providing enough time for the redesign of website. Your detailed reviews were helpful throughout the development of website. I really appreciate the fact that there were no strict constraints on using particular framework/technology, and on time.
	
The approach of the design is to represent the most of content of website as a list of cards where each card has particular set of properties. I have tried to write most of the code in core html,css,js split into module of cards and the website should run properly in most of the devices.
	
I have some requests for you. Can you please write a proof of internship letter/certificate with my name on it. I have to show one at the end of vacations in my college. It would be really helpful if you could provide that.  Also it would be great for me to receive a feedback from you. If you don’t have the time or if you’re not interested, it’s all good.
	
I don't know much about neural networks but still I feel that the researches of visual geometry group are quite amazing .Extracting information from multimedia objects is a cool idea.

If anytime in future, you have an issue regarding website or you want to add/update a feature , please let me know and i will try to fix it as soon as possible. I look forward to working on more website projects relating to visual geometry group.

Thanks for reading this !!
