	visual recognition, and large scale retrieval in images and video.
	He has authored over 350 peer reviewed papers in computer vision,
	and coedited and written several books in this area.
	His papers have won many best paper awards at international
	conferences (at CVPR, ICCV and BMVC), including the IEEE Marr
	prize three times. He regularly serves as programme chair or
	general chair for international computer vision conferences.
	In 2002 he received a Technical Emmy Award (with the company 2d3)
	for camera-tracking software. In 2013 he was awarded the Longuet-Higgins
	prize and the IEEE PAMI Distinguished Researcher award.

*   # Prof. Alison Noble

    Prof. Alison Noble, OBE FREng, is the Technikos Professor of Biomedical
	Engineering in the Oxford University Department of Engineering Science
	and the Director of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering. She is a
	Fellow of the IET, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and
	Past-President of the MICCAI Society. She was awarded an OBE for services
	to Science and Engineering in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in June 2013\.
	Professor Noble is the founding director of the Biomedical Image Analysis
	(BioMedIA) Laboratory, an inter-disciplinary research group working in the
	field of biomedical image analysis based at the Oxford Institute of Biomedical
	Engineering. Her group is supported by research awards from EPSRC, NIHR, NIH,
	InnovateUK, and the Wellcome Trust. Much of her group’s current research
	concerns machine-learning applied to biomedical image analysis with a focus
	on clinical applications of ultrasound imaging. Professor Noble has published
	around 300 peer-reviewed papers. She is also a co-founder and the Chief Technology
	Officer of Intelligent Ultrasound Ltd.

*   # Prof. Andrea Vedaldi

    [![](images/inv3.jpg)]("#")

    Prof. Andrea Vedaldi is Professor in the Department of Engineering Science
	at the University of Oxford. He is an expert in large scale machine learning
	and optimization applied to semantic image understanding. Prof. Vedaldi is
	the author of more than 30 peer-reviewed publications. He is project leader
	of VLFeat, a very popular computer vision software toolkit (ACM Open Source Award 2010).
	In 2012 he was team leader of the Johns Hopkins CLSP summer research workshop,
	coordinating a number of senior researchers and students in a research program
	on detailed image understanding. He is collaborating with BP on several
	applications of computer vision to the gas and oil industry and with MirriAd
	on image understanding applied to virtual advertisement. He serves regularly
	as area chair and reviewer of the top computer vision conferences (ICCV/CVPR/ECCV/BMVC)
	and he is an editor of TPAMI. He organised five tutorials at ECCV and CVPR and three
	international computer vision summer schools (JHU NAACL, PAVIS).

*   # Prof. Phil Torr

    [![](images/inv4.jpg)]("#")

    Prof. Phil Torr is Professorial Research Fellow in the Oxford University
	Department of Engineering Science. He has worked on several areas of
	computer vision including energy models for scene understanding, online tracking
	and learning of objects, and robust estimation of multiview geometry.
	He has received best paper awards in every major computer vision conference
	(ICCV, ECCV, CVPR, BMVC) and an honourable mention at NIPS. In the past ten
	years, Prof. Torr has attracted nearly five million pounds of funding (EPSRC and ERC).
	His work has had extensive application in the creative industries, with recent
	technology transfers including contributions to Vicon’s motion capture technology
	(won Best KTP 2009), and vision technology underlying Sony’s Wonderbook.
	He is also Director of new Oxford based spin out Oxsight, working on smart
	specs for the partially sighted. Last year Prof. Torr was program chair of
	the top conference in computer vision ICCV, and in the past was program chair
	for ECCV and BMVC.

*   # Prof. Jens Rittscher

    [![](images/inv5.jpg)]("#")

    The research of Prof. Jens Rittscher is to enable biomedical imaging through
	the development of new algorithms and novel computational platforms.
	The current focus of his research is to improve mechanistic understanding
	of cancer and patient care through quantitative analysis of image data.
	In 2013, he was appointed to the first joint academic appointment between
	the Department of Engineering Science and the Nuffield Department of Medicine 
	(NDM) at the University of Oxford. He has been awarded the title of Professor
	of Engineering Science. He is a group leader at the NDM's Target Discovery
	Institute and is a member of the Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research.
	rior to coming to Oxford, Prof. Rittscher was a senior research scientist
	and manager at GE Global Research in Niskayuna (NY, USA), one of the world’s
	largest and most diversified industrial research laboratories. Building on
	his extensive expertise in computer vision, probabilistic modelling and statistical
	learning, he developed new theoretical approaches that address specific real-world
	challenge problems in automated video annotation, visual surveillance, and biomedical
	imaging. In the context of biomedical imaging he worked on applications ranging
	from monitoring cellular processes and computational pathology to the development
	of an anatomical atlas for zebrafish imaging. In addition he held a position as an
	adjunct professor at the Rensselear Polytechnic Institute in Troy (NY, USA). In
	2001 he was awarded a DPhil from the University of Oxford for his work on
	recognizing human motion.
