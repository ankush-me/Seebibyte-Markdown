#	To Ankush and Seebibyte Team,

Since the website is near completion, I decided to leave a short message. Thank you for providing enough time for the redesign of website. Your detailed reviews were helpful throughout the development of website. I really appreciate the fact that there were no strict constraints on using particular framework/technology, and on time.
	
The approach of the design is to represent the most of content of website as a list of cards where each card has particular set of properties. I have tried to write most of the code in core html,css,js split into module of cards and the website should run properly in most of the devices.
	
I don't know much about neural networks but still I feel that the researches of visual geometry group are quite amazing .Extracting information from multimedia objects is a cool idea.
