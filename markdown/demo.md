*   # Demo 1: BBC

    ## VISUAL SEARCH OF BBC NEWS

    ![](images/demo1.png)

    This is a technical demo of the large-scale on-the-fly web search
	technologies which are under development in the Oxford University
	Visual Geometry Group, using data provided by BBC R&D comprising
	over five years of prime-time news broadcasts from six channels.
	The demo consists of three different components, which can be used
	to query the dataset on-the-fly for three different query types:
	object search, image search and people search.

    ## VISUAL SEARCH OF PAINTINGS

    ![](images/demo2.png)

    The objective of this research is to find objects in paintings by
	learning classifiers from photographs on the internet. We provide
	a live demo that allows a user to search for an object of their
	choosing (such as "baby", "bird", or "dog, for example) in a dataset
	of over 200,000 paintings, in a matter of seconds.

    ## VISUAL SEARCH OF PAINTINGS

    Our work allows computers to recognize objects in images, what is
	distinctive about our work is that we also recover the 2D outline
	of the object. Currently we have trained this model to recognize 20
	classes. The demo below allows you to test our algorithm on your
	own images â€“ have a try and see if you can fool it, if you get some
	good examples you can send them to us. Why are we doing this? This
	work is part of a project to build augmented reality glasses for the
	partially sighted.
